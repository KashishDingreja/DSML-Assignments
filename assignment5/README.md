# Supermarket Dataset Visualization

This repository contains code snippets to visualize the insurance dataset using Python's seaborn and matplotlib libraries.

## Problem Statement: 
Visualize the dataset provided for Assignment No. 1 and 2 using either R/Python or Tableau. Select a suitable dataset for visualization.
a) Using R/Python:
   - Utilize Scatter plot, bar plot, Box plot, and Histogram to visualize the dataset effectively.
     OR
b) Using Tableau:
   - Perform data visualization operations using Tableau for the provided dataset.


## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the methodology outlined for data visualization using Google Colab, alongside Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy, provides a robust framework for exploring and interpreting the university dataset. By following the steps of data importing, preprocessing, visualization, interactivity, and presentation, we have effectively leveraged these tools to gain insights into various aspects of university data. The visualizations generated, including scatter plots, bar plots, box plots, and histograms, have enabled us to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. Through interactive features, stakeholders can dynamically explore the data, gaining deeper insights and making more informed decisions.
